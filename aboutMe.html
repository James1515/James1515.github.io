    <h2>How I Got Into Computer Science</h2>
    <div>
    <p>
      Since I was a kid, I was always interested in the way electronics and
      digital circuitury worked. My grandfather, in fact, was an electrical
      engineer and brought me into the world of electronics and computers.
      Eventually, I obtained my first computer which was an Apple IIe.
      It also became the computer I would use to learn programming using Apple BASIC,
      which is the "grandfather" of Visual Basic which people still use today.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my middle school and high school years, I took typewriting lessons, and
      with it, learned how to program in Java, and do Web Design using HTML and CSS.
      I was also introduced to open-source, using Ubuntu Linux at home at a time when
      the linux kernel was just beginning to gain popularity for programmers. By the
      time I got to college, I was more than convinced that this was the field I wanted
      to get into. Before I knew it, I was completeing my prerequsities to complete
      my Mathematics minor and first projects in old-school ANSI C, and then later
      useing Java 6 several years back.

    <h2>What Am I Working on Currently</h2>
    <div>
    <p>
      Having completed the required classes to transfer over to
      Florida State, I immediately began working on core requirements
      in my Computer Science degree. During the first year, I was able to be better
      literate in UNIX-based Operating Systems and made Ubuntu my favorite distribution
      to work on - with emacs being my favorite editor. Thanks to the background
      I had previously with C++, I learned OOP useing C++11, as well as Data Structures
      and Algorithms which was interesting and very challenging due to the nature of the
      language. I then took courses useing a dynamic range of languages - from
      MIPS and X86 Assembly to even Ada (which I made a report on while takeing a
      Programming Languages course). So far as a Senior-level student,
      I have completed courses and projects discussing all of the above, plus: Compiler Construction,
      Computer Architecture, Operating Systems Design, Discrete Mathematics, Engineering Statistics,
      Mobile Programming with Android, and Database Design and Development.
    </p>

    <p>
      As of Fall 2019, I will be completing
      courses and projects discussing Expert Systems, Web-Applications Programming, Theory of Computation, and
      a Software Engineering practicum.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am also takeing several certifications outside of my degree through DataQuest
      on Data Science with Python, you can find my progress there through this link.

  <!--- My Future Career Goals: --->
  
  <section>
    <h2>My Career Goals</h2>
    <div>
    <p>
      The main focus and preparation of my studies have been around Software Development. Recently,
      there has been a great focus on Artificial Intelligence in the programming world through Python
      and that has definitely caught my eye. One of my goals is to create several applications in
      natural language processing. I would also like to do more of "backend" work rather
      than front-end in C++, Java, or Python. However for the time being, I am just looking for a foothold
      as a Software Engineer or a Data Scientist, whether it may be with a startup or a major company.
