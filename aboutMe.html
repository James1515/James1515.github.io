    <p>Greetings, and welcome to my site. My name is James Ortiz, and I am a Computer Science major at Florida State University.
      While I am takeing courses remotely from FSU, I have great interest in Software Development through C++, Java, and Python.
      My main interest has been on the topics of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Mobile Development. The main purpose
      of the constructon of this site is to help share useful information, and provide a backdrop to employers about my interests.
