	This course is intended for majors in computer science or related areas and focuses on the fundamental concepts of computer programming using the C++ language. This course may be used as a programming pre-requisite for COP 3330. Successful completion of this course satisfies the computer competency requirement for the mathematics major. Upon successful completion of the course, the student should be able to: Demonstrate a basic understanding of computer concepts, including software and hardware. Solve computing problems using a top-down approach in a well-structured design using procedural programming techniques Design, implement, test, and debug a C++ program to solve a given problem. Demonstrate knowledge and use of control structures used in procedural programming, including sequence, selection, iteration, and functions. Make use of data types and structures in C++ including integer and floating point types, arrays (one-dimensional, two-dimensional, strings) and structs; arrays of structs and structs containing arrays. Have a introductory-level understanding of the C++ class and be able to utilize the standard IO and string classes and their member functions. Utilize fundamental algorithms studied to perform common tasks, such as finding the max and min of a data set, counting, summing, tracking a previous value, searching and sorting, reading until EOF, etc. Consider, compare, and evaluate code segments or simple algorithms for relative efficiency in a basic fashion. Make use of pointers: understanding their relationship with arrays, their use in function parameters and returns, and their importance in dynamic memory allocation.
