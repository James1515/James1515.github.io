    <h1>James Ortiz's Portfolio & Homepage</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>Hello, and welcome to my homepage!</p>
    <p>
      I am currently a senior Computer Scientist major at FSU, and decided
      to construct this website mainly as a means to showcase my
      work as a developer - both in academia and outside
      of my coursework. I hope you'll find my projects and
      links both interesting and informative.
