      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Description:</u></strong>
	Cscan is a lexical analyzer for a C compiler. It identifies the C
	tokens from its standard input and writes them to its standard output,
	one per line. Afterwards it prints the number of occurrences of
	each type of token (number, ident, char, string, or the lexeme for
	the remaining types of tokens) in descending order.
