      My most influential projects done at Florida State University. Here
      you will find the most challenging and interesting ones I have done
      thus far. Every project comes with an associated image that links over to a gitlab repository. The descriptions highlight the concepts discussed and the topics that were learned by each.

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Project #1:</u></strong><i> C Scanner/Tokenizer</i></p>
      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Description:</u></strong>
	Cscan is a lexical analyzer for a C compiler. It identifies the C
	tokens from its standard input and writes them to its standard output,
	one per line. Afterwards it prints the number of occurrences of
	each type of token (number, ident, char, string, or the lexeme for
	the remaining types of tokens) in descending order.
      </p>
      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Technologies and/or Languages Used:</u></strong> C99, C++, Ubuntu Linux </p>

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Project #2:</u></strong><i> Rock, Paper, Spear Android App </i></p>

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Description:</u></strong>
	A tic-tac-toe Android app that allows 2 players to play
	against each other using the computer's logic. The incorpoartion
	of the game includes built in logic that checks if player "X" has two
	matric elements in a row player "O" will detect that and block. The
	app also allows the user to restart the game, as well as the score. 
      </p>

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Technologies and/or Languages Used:</u>
	</strong>Java, Android API, Android Studio, Ubuntu Linux</p>

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Project #3:</u></strong><i>MIPS Assembler in C/C++</i></p>
      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Description:</u></strong>
	A C++ Assembler writtent for the MIPS32 Instruction Set Architecture.
	This is an assembler for a subset of the MIPS instruction set. The program will read the assembly file from
	standard input and then write the machine code to standard output.
      </p>

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Technologies and/or Languages Used:</u>
	</strong>C, C++, MIPS Instruction Set Architecture, Ubuntu Linux</p>

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Project #4:</u></strong><i> Train-Ticketing Management System</i></p>
      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Description:</u></strong>
	The Train-Ticketing Management System is a simulation of a database designed to handle reservation requests, and arbitrate control of the status of the booked ticket (cancellation, and reservation), as well as a train's time  as well as a train's status. Passenger information will be maintained in the booking aspect of the Management System. When booking, the train number, date, and category are read from the passenger. According to the values provided by the passenger, the record can then be retrieved from TrainStatus. Two seating options will be available for the passenger "Economy" and "Coach". For example, if the passenger has selected the Coach option, then the total number of reserved Coach seats, and coach seats will be compared to determine whether the seat can be booked. If the ticket can be booked then the passenger details are to be stored in the passenger table. If a ticket needs to be cancelled the Ticket ID is read from the passenger and the record is searched in the Passenger table. If the record is found it is then deleted from the database.

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Technologies and/or Languages Used:</u>
	</strong> MySQL, MariaDB, Ubuntu Linux</p>

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Project #5:</u></strong><i> Word-Bench API</i></p>
      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Description:</u></strong>

	This API can read an arbitrary text file on command and extract all of the words in the file, maintaining the unique words, along with the frequency of occurrence of each word, in a set. Letters are converted to lower case before comparison and storage. A word is understood to be a string of letters and/or digits, with certain other symbols allowed. Most non-alpha-numeric characters are ignored. Exceptions are hyphens and apostrophes, which are considered part of the word, so that contractions and hyphenated constructs are counted as individual words. (Note: two adjacent apostrophes are not considered part of a word, since they represent closing of a quotation.)
	WordBench can write an analysis of its current stored words. This analysis consists of a lexicographical listing of the unique words together with their frequencies, followed by a count of the total number of words and the vocabulary size (number of unique words).

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Technologies and/or Languages Used:</u>
	</strong>C++11, API Creation, GNU Make, Ubuntu Linux</p>

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Project #6:</u></strong><i> Priority-Scheduler for XV6 Operating System</i></p>
      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Description:</u></strong>
	A priority-based scheduler always selects the process
	with the highest priority for execution. If there are multiple processes with
	the same highest priority, the scheduler uses round-robin to execute them in
	turn to avoid starvation. This is an example of a replacement of a complete "round-robin"
	scheduler used originally with the XV6 - a diminutive unix-based operating system.
      </p>

      <p class="class-desc"><strong><u>Technologies and/or Languages Used:</u>
	</strong>ANSI C, C99, QEMU, GNU Make, Ubuntu Linux</p>
